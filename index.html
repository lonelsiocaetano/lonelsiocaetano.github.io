                        <p> I’m a software engineering undergraduate with 2 years of experience in operational leadership and 1 year of in IT. I am a responsible, motivated, and adaptable team member who can navigate through high-stress situations, and well-versed
                            in monitoring people.</p>
                        <p>Besides my experience, I bring a great attitude and a willingness to take on any task. This is something I gained from my last job because of having multiple tasks to do at a time. I look for ways to help whether, in the simplest
                            or most complex tasks, I always strive to make myself useful and make a suitable working environment. I’d bring this same energy and enthusiasm to the company.</p>

                <div class="sectionContent">
                    <ul class="key Skills">
                        <li>Communication skill and operational leadership: when in the Position of a First Sergeant of Bravo Company, my role always included operational leadership because I was always delegating work, receiving, and giving orders to cadets.
                            Communication was very important to keep the tasks going 24/7.</li>
                        <li>Flexibility and adaptability: while taking on many types of roles and even in school, the ability to make necessary changes at an unexpected time is something I have had to deal with many times. However, I am always open to changes
                            and learning new things, and I’m able to navigate through high-stress situations.</li>
                        <li>Maintained Cleanliness: I have been at boarding schools since middle school, and I never leave the room without making the bed. As a first sergeant that had to delegate work to subordinates, I had to set the example, and that also
                            means having maintained cleanliness. It creates a healthier environment and boosts my efficiency and productivity.</li>
